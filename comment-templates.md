### Rotten code in a PR

> Thank you for your PR! However, a lot of time passed since this PR was opened, so now it needs to be rebased to the `master`.

> Could you look at this issue once again? There is a chance it was fixed somewhere on the road, but if it is not, feel free to rebase your patch to the master. Otherwise, in a month or so I could close it, to keep our PR queue clean.
