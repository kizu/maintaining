### Rotten code in a PR


    Thank you for your PR! However, a lot of time passed since this PR was opened, so now it needs to be rebased to the `master`.

    Could you look at this issue once again? There is a chance it was fixed somewhere on the road, but if it is not, feel free to rebase your patch to the master. Otherwise, in a month or so I could close it, to keep our PR queue clean.

### Closing a PR with the rotten code

    As I wrote in the previous comment, I'm closing this PR to keep PR queue clean. If you'd find time and rebase your patch to the master, we would welcome a new PR.
    
    Anyway, thank you for the work you've done there!

### A lot of rotten code in a big PR

    Thank you for your PR! However, a lot of time passed since this PR was opened, so now it needs to be rebased to the master.

    I know, this is a big PR and rebasing it would need a lot of work, but I would be happy if you'd do it. Otherwise, in a month or so I could close it, to keep our PR queue clean, but you still could open a new PR with the rebased code in the future.
